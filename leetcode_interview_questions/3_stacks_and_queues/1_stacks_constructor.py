"""
# Stack: Constructor
Create a Stack class that represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure using a linked list implementation.

The Stack class should contain the following components:
- A Node class, which serves as the building block for the linked list.
- The Node class should have an __init__ method that initializes the following attributes:
    - value: The value of the node.
    - next: A reference to the next node in the list, initialized to None.
- The Stack class should have an __init__ method that initializes the stack with a single node, using the given value.

The __init__ method should perform the following tasks:
- Create a new instance of the Node class using the provided value.
- Set the top attribute of the Stack class to point to the new node.
- Initialize a height attribute for the Stack class, which represents the current number of nodes in the stack, and set it to 1.
