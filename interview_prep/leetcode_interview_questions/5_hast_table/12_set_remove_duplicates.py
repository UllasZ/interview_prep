# Set: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)

- You have been given a list my_list with some duplicate values.
- Your task is to write a Python program that removes all the duplicates from the list using a set
  and then prints the updated list.
- You need to implement a function remove_duplicates(my_list) that takes in the input list my_list as a parameter
  and returns a new list with no duplicates.
- Your function should not modify the original list, instead, it should create a new list with unique values and return it.

Example:
    Input: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Note:
The order of the elements in the updated list may be different from the original list, as sets are unordered.

def remove_duplicates(my_list):
    return list(set(my_list))


my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
new_list = remove_duplicates(my_list)
print(new_list)


"""
    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    (Order may be different as sets are unordered)
